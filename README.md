# Background

This repository contains an MS pulling workflow that uses the SLURM requeue functionality to continually attempt to pull MS data from the SARAO archive via katdal's `mvftoms.py` script. Katdal introduced new functionality with version 0.20.1 to resume the pulling of MS data from a previously incomplete transfer, by taking the last written dump, removing it, and continuing from there. Katdal also introduced additional features to improve the stablility of remote transfers (see issue [here](https://github.com/ska-sa/katdal/issues/362) and pull request [here](https://github.com/ska-sa/katdal/pull/363)). Known issues with this approach are listed below.

# Installing software dependencies

This workflow requires katdal as a software dependency, which can simply be installed following the instructions documented [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Na1Tq6AUHwESaucmG0qcaBAPUcif8637_p4Zah4WU6s/edit#heading=h.lhu2yo6xjrdn). It also requires the `requeue-MS-transfer.sbatch` and `check_data.py` scripts to be in your working directory.

_The script basically relies on `check_data.py` crashing when the MS is incomplete, which only really checks the metadata with CASA's msmd tool. However, msmd is very good at crashing when the MS isnâ€™t intact due to all the data integrity checks it does up-front._

# Running the software

The workflow is run by passing in an RDB link, which is copied to your clipboard when clicking the very left hand icon on the [SARAO archive](https://archive.sarao.ac.za) for the CBID of interest (only shown when data is on disk and not tape), which will be labelled as "32KW", "4KW", "UHF", or similar, like so:

    ./requeue-MS-transfer.sh https://archive-gw-1.kat.ac.za/0123456789/0123456789_sdp_l0.full.rdb?token=blah

After passing in the RDB link as the first argument, the workflow will also take any `mvftoms.py` selection parameters passed in. For example:

    ./requeue-MS-transfer.sh https://archive-gw-1.kat.ac.za/0123456789/0123456789_sdp_l0.full.rdb?token=blah --flags=cam,data_lost -C 0,21591 -p HH,VV -a

Finally, using CBID 1680420378, a full example with the RDB link and its token (now expired) is provided below:

    ./requeue-MS-transfer.sh https://archive-gw-1.kat.ac.za/1680420378/1680420378_sdp_l0.full.rdb?token=eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJFUzI1NiJ9.eyJpc3MiOiJrYXQtYXJjaGl2ZS5rYXQuYWMuemEiLCJhdWQiOiJhcmNoaXZlLWd3LTEua2F0LmFjLnphIiwiaWF0IjoxNzA2MTU0ODMzLCJwcmVmaXgiOlsiMTY4MDQyMDM3OCJdLCJleHAiOjE3MDY3NTk2MzMsInN1YiI6ImpvcmRhbkBpZGlhLmFjLnphIiwic2NvcGVzIjpbInJlYWQiXX0.iGZuC2RAga8acD0i5cYZCN_6FsOc5vKn9I7uqMjH2Ezn5emtZoB9tkhyyFUzhrpMFBD7BdtYXfUz_wR4g78oEw -f --flags=cam,data_lost -a --chanbin=8 --quack=1

Upon launching the script, the SLURM job name will be updated to `transfer_MS_${CBID}`, a confirmation of the job launching will be output, displaying the CBID, and the email provided in the sbatch header will be emailed when the job starts, ends, fails, and/or hits the 80% time limit (`BEGIN,END,FAIL,TIME_LIMIT_80`).

# Known issues

If the workflow is interrupted, such as timing out, running out of memory, or crashing, it usually leaves the MS in a corrupt state, and any attempts to resume the transfer with katdal with fail. This is as opposed to katdal experiencing a connection issue, and although these are uncommon since the improvements mentioned above, katdal can still resume a transfer following such an error. Some more information and possible future katdal development to get around leaving the MS in a corrupted state is listed [here](https://github.com/ska-sa/katdal/issues/362#issuecomment-1411852385).
